### Motivation

Reanimated is Awesome ðŸ˜Ž. And with the release of v2, it's faster, new internals & the API quite refined. Hence the semantics are a bit different from v1 therefore there's some exploration and tinkering required to get comfortable with the new API.

### How it bridges the gap?

The idea behind this playground is inspired by a similar problem I have solved in past by React Native Elements Playground ðŸš€.
With this, a user can test various possibilities with the ecosystem and generate a code snippet on the fly (coming soon).

### State of the Project

The project is at a very early stage and with the help of the community, we can make it stable and add more flavours.

### Support the Project

Please consider contributing to the project with code or innovation playground ideas.
