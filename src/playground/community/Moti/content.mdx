### Moti

Moti is the universal animation package for React Native, made by [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo).

```tsx

    opacity: 0,
  }}

Moti has a number of powerful features that make your animations slick and simple.

```ts
import { View, Text } from "moti";
```

##### Mount animations

You can set the initial state with `from`. Any styles passed to `animate` will transition for you.

```tsx
<View 
  from={{ 
    opacity: 0
  }} 
  animate={{ 
    opacity: 1
   }} 
/>
```

##### Animate based on React state

```tsx
<View 
  animate={{ 
    opacity: isLoading ? 1 : 0 
  }} 
/>
```

This is useful for dynamic height changes, for instance.

```tsx
const [height, setHeight] = useMeasure()

<View
  animate={{
    height,
  }}
/>
```

##### Customize your animation

Moti animations are highly configurable, thanks to the `transition` prop. If you've used `framer-motion`, this will look familiar.

```tsx
<View
  from={{ 
    opacity: 0, 
    scale: 0.5 
  }}
  animate={{ 
    opacity: 1, 
    scale: 1 
  }}
  transition={{
    type: "timing",
    duration: 350,
  }}
/>
```

You can also configure different transitions per-style:

```tsx
<View
  from={{ 
    opacity: 0, 
    scale: 0.5 
    }}
  animate={{ 
    opacity: 1, 
    scale: 1
    }}
  transition={{
    type: "timing",
    duration: 350,
    // set a custom transition for scale
    scale: {
      type: "spring",
      delay: 100,
    },
  }}
/>
```

If you set `type: 'spring'`, you can pass any options that Reanimated's `withSpring` accepts. Same goes for `type: 'timing'` & Reanimated's `withTiming`.
